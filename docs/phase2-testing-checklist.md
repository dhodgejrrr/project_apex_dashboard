2. Test dropdown open/close performance
3. Test car selection change performance
4. Monitor memory usage during interactions
5. Test with large datasets (if available)

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Page loads in <2 seconds
- âœ… Dropdown interactions are smooth (<100ms)
- âœ… Car selection updates quickly
- âœ… No memory leaks during extended use
- âœ… Performance acceptable with large datasets

---

## **Test Data Scenarios**

### **Test with `test_race` Dataset:**
**Available Data:**
- Cars: #1 (Max Verstappen), #16 (Charles Leclerc), #55 (Carlos Sainz)
- Expected Events per Car:
  - Race Start event
  - Fastest Lap event  
  - Fastest Sector events (S1, S2, S3)
