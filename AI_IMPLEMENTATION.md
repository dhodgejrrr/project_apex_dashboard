# AI Chat Agent Implementation Summary

## âœ… What We've Implemented

### 1. **OpenRouter API Integration**
- Created a new custom hook `useOpenRouterChat` that replaces the previous Tavus integration
- Supports multiple AI models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro, etc.)
- Proper error handling and type safety with TypeScript

### 2. **Secure API Key Management**
- Environment variable configuration (`VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- `.env.local` support for local development
- `.gitignore` already includes environment files
- Created deployment guide for production environments

### 3. **Data Context Integration**
- Automatically injects race data, insights, and social media data into AI context
- Uses existing `DataContext` to access `raceDataString`, `insightsDataString`, and `socialDataString`
- Comprehensive system prompt that instructs the AI on how to analyze the data

### 4. **Enhanced Chat UI**
- Updated `AIAgentDashboard` to use the new OpenRouter integration
- Improved suggested questions that are specific to the available data
- Markdown rendering for AI responses
- Loading states, error handling, and conversation management

### 5. **Documentation & Deployment**
- Updated README.md with OpenRouter AI features
- Created `.env.example` with proper API key configuration
- Added `DEPLOYMENT.md` with security best practices
- JSDoc comments for better code documentation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Hook Architecture (`useOpenRouterChat`)
```typescript
- startConversation(dataContext) // Initializes AI with race data
- sendMessage(message) // Sends user message and gets AI response  
- clearConversation() // Resets conversation state
- State: messages[], isLoading, error, isConversationStarted
```

### API Flow
1. **Initialization**: System prompt generated with all race data
2. **User Message**: Added to conversation history
3. **API Call**: Sent to OpenRouter with full conversation context
4. **AI Response**: Processed and displayed with markdown formatting
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user-friendly error messages

### Data Context
- **Race Data**: Complete telemetry and timing data
- **Insights Data**: AI-generated race analysis and marketing angles
- **Social Media Data**: Generated social media posts with priorities

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### For Developers
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Add your OpenRouter API key
3. Optionally specify AI model preference
4. Run `npm run dev`

### For Users
1. Upload race data files through the dashboard
2. Navigate to "AI Agent" tab
3. Start asking questions about the race
4. Use suggested questions or ask custom queries

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

- **Context-Aware**: AI understands your specific race data
- **Multi-Model Support**: Choose the best AI model for your needs
- **Cost Control**: Transparent pricing and model selection
- **Secure**: API keys properly managed and never exposed
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Markdown Support**: Rich formatting in AI responses

## ðŸ“Š Example Queries That Work

Based on the provided data, users can ask:
- "What was BMW's performance advantage in this race?"
- "Tell me about the pit stop efficiency mentioned in the insights"
- "Which social media posts were marked as high priority?"
- "Analyze the tire degradation issues mentioned"
- "Summarize the marketing angles for this race"

## ðŸ”’ Security & Best Practices

- API keys stored in environment variables only
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Spending limits recommended in OpenRouter dashboard
- Model selection for cost optimization
- Regular API key rotation recommended
